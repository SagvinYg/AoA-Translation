Like most of the other Vox Ponds creatures, the Alarmo seems to have become mutated and merged with some of the surrounding structures, combining its previously natural head with a metallic cage.

No-one is really sure how they have managed to survive so long, as their primary method of attack when challenged is to charge directly at the target and explode, killing itself in the process.
