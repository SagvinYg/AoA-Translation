A very agile animal, the Elkanyne roam the savannahs of the overworld, grazing on grass and shrubs. They are easily spooked, and as such it is not recommended to attempt to sneak up on one.

Elkanyne are very territorial and will defend their home from invaders without much care for personal safety. Their high mobility and strong sharp antlers make them a dangerous animal to be confronted by.

Additionally, their high mobility makes them extremely evasive and hard to retaliate against. Prior experience in combat will be required to have any chance of landing a blow on one of these creatures.
